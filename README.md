# Microsoft-Malware-Detection
This project include feature engineering on byte files and asm files which are the two types of files that are generated by virus. The files are divided into 9 classes which reflects it is a multi-class classification. The model is trained using XGBoost over large no. of features. The model is trained on unigram, bigram, pixel intensity and entropy features which are extracted from the byte and asm files which consists of hexadecimal values.The performance metric used for this machine learning project is log-loss. The log-loss is minimized to less than 0.025 to reduce the misclassification.
